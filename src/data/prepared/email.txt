Subject: Risk Assessment & Quote Request – GB Shipping plc (Hull & Loss-of-Hire)

Dear Ian Surer,

I hope you are well. Thank you for your ongoing dialogue regarding North-Sea tonnage; please accept my apologies for the brief delay in forwarding the full submission.

GB Shipping plc was founded in 2002 in London to provide short-sea and offshore support services. Today it owns and operates 40 vessels (about 1.2 million DWT) and is the second-largest privately held UK-flag fleet. Long-term charters with blue-chip energy majors and liner companies underpin its earnings.

Fleet details
• 15 container feeders – average age 7.4 years – trading North-West Europe
• 10 Handy/Supramax bulk carriers – average age 9.1 years – Atlantic and Baltic routes
• 8 product tankers – average age 8.6 years – UK-Continent and Mediterranean clean-product trades
• 4 subsea/ROV support vessels – average age 6.2 years – North-Sea oil, gas and wind projects
• 3 LNG-electric hybrid MPSVs – average age 2.1 years – offshore wind and decommissioning work

Five additional hybrid MPSVs are on order for delivery 2026–2027, targeting the 19 GW UK offshore-wind build-out and the decommissioning of 470 legacy North-Sea platforms.

GB Shipping has invested more than £24 million since 2021 in predictive analytics and safety technology, driving lower incident frequency.

• Digital-twin telemetry and vibration monitoring – real-time shaft-line, bearing and main-engine data are streamed ashore; algorithms flag anomalies above twice baseline RMS. In January 2024 the system on MV GB Pathfinder detected rising thrust-bearing vibration 72 hours before failure, allowing proactive maintenance that avoided a £650 k Hull claim and five days’ off-hire.

• AI-powered PPE and man-over-board video analytics – 180 IP cameras and AI models verify helmet, harness and life-vest compliance while triggering bridge alarms if a person falls overboard. Near-miss safety breaches fell 35 percent year-on-year and the company posted zero lost-time injuries in 2023.

• Hybrid propulsion and smart weather-routing – the three LNG-electric MPSVs cut fuel consumption 25 percent and CO₂ emissions 19 kt per year, while routing software steers bulkers clear of heavy-weather risk, reducing damage claims.
