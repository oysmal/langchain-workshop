Subject: Insurance Proposal for OceanTrans Shipping - Urgent Consideration
Date: April 16, 2023

Dear Underwriting Team,

I am writing to present an insurance proposal for Bergen Shipping Company, a well-established maritime transport company based in Bergen. They are seeking hull and machinery coverage for two of their vessels, with our company taking a 65% share of the total risk. We're seeking a partner for the remaining 35%.

Attached to this email, you will find:
1. Company profile with detailed vessel information
2. Formal insurance proposal with coverage details and premium calculations

Key points to consider:

- Bergen has been in operation since 1985 with a solid reputation in the industry
- The vessels in question (MV Atlantic Voyager, IMO 9123456 and MV Pacific Explorer, IMO 9234567) are relatively new and well-maintained
- The company has implemented enhanced security measures following industry best practices
- The premium has been calculated based on current market rates and the specific risk profile

I would like to highlight that we have worked with Bergen Shipping Company previously on smaller policies, and they have been prompt with premium payments and transparent in their operations.

Given the competitive nature of this opportunity, I would appreciate your expedited review of this proposal. The client is expecting responses from multiple insurers by April 25th.

Please let me know if you require any additional information to assist with your assessment.

Best regards,
